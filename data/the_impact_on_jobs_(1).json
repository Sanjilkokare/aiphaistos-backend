Artificial Intelligence is transforming the workplace automating tasks, redefining roles, and reshaping industries.  This project explores which jobs are most at risk and why, using real- world data from Kaggle.  We analyze features like task complexity, workload ratios, and AI model usage to uncover patterns.  Our goal is to understand whether jobs are being eliminated or merely transformed.  This analysis helps workers and policymakers prepare for the future of employment.", "To identify which job roles are most vulnerable to AI automation. To analyze how factors like task complexity, model usage, and workload ratio influence AI impact. To classify jobs into low, medium, and high AI-risk categories. To determine whether jobs are being eliminated or simply transformed. To apply regression modeling to predict AI risk based on job traits.", "\ud83d\udccd Source:  Kaggle \u2013 \u201cAI Impact on Jobs\u201d (by UnclePablo) \ud83e\uddfe Dataset Description:  A comprehensive dataset capturing the estimated AI automation risk across nearly 4,700 job titles. Key Variables: Job Title \u2013 Role or profession name Tasks \u2013 Average number of distinct tasks per job AI Models \u2013 Types of AI models relevant to each role AI Workload Ratio \u2013 Proportion of tasks considered automatable AI Impact \u2013 Estimated probability of AI impact \ud83d\udca1 Goal of Dataset Use:  To identify which job characteristics (e.g., task complexity, AI model exposure) influence vulnerability to AI-driven disruption.", "Handled Infinite Values  Replaced infinite values in the AI_Workload_Ratio column with NaN to avoid analysis distortion. Missing Value Treatment  Checked for nulls across all key columns and removed or handled rows with incomplete data.Data Type Conversion  Converted all relevant columns like Tasks, AI Models, and AI_Workload_Ratio to numeric formats to support statistical analysis. Consistency Checks  Ensured uniform naming, removed special characters, and validated data ranges.", "\ud83d\udd1d Top 10 Most AI-Impacted Jobs We sorted the dataset by AI Impact Score to identify the most vulnerable roles: Communications Manager Data Entry Clerk Mail Clerk Compliance Officer Administrative Services (Others as shown in         your bar chart)", "\ud83e\uddea Objective:  To understand how different features such as Tasks, AI Models used, and AI Workload Ratio relate to AI Impact. Steps Taken: We used the Pearson correlation method to compute pairwise correlations between numeric features. Visualized the correlation matrix using a heatmap. \ud83d\udcca Key Findings:        \ud83d\udfe2 AI Workload Ratio had a moderate positive correlation with AI Impact.        \ud83d\udd34 Tasks and AI Models showed weak or even negative correlation with AI Impact. \ud83e\udde0 Insight:  Automatability is more dependent on the proportion of work that AI can take over, not just the variety of tasks or the AI tools being used.", "regplotheatmap scatterplot", "Slide Title: Categorizing Jobs by AI Risk \ud83e\udde9 What You Did: Manually segmented jobs into 3 risk levels based on their AI Impact scores: High Risk: AI Impact > 0.75 Medium Risk: AI Impact between 0.4 and 0.75 Low Risk: AI Impact < 0.4 \ud83d\udcc8 Visual: Pie chart showing the distribution: Low Risk \u2192  ~69% Medium Risk \u2192  ~29% High Risk \u2192  ~2% \ud83d\udca1 Insight: Majority of jobs fall under low to medium risk, indicating transformation over elimination. Very few jobs are in the high-risk category \u2014 mostly repetitive or automatable tasks.", "\ud83d\udcd0 Classification Logic: You defined job status based on AI Impact score: \ud83d\udfe5 Eliminated \u2192  AI Impact > 0.75 \ud83d\udfe9 Transformed \u2192  AI Impact \u2264 0.75 \ud83d\udcca Visuals Used: \u2705 Countplot showing number of jobs in each category \u2705 Scatterplot (Tasks vs. AI Impact), color-coded by job status", "\ud83e\uddea Model Used: \u2705 Linear Regression (from Scikit-learn) \ud83e\uddee Features: Tasks AI Models AI Workload Ratio \ud83c\udfaf Target Variable: AI Impact \ud83d\udcca Key Finding: The most influential predictor was the AI Workload Ratio. Tasks and AI Models had less explanatory power individually. Insight: The more of a job\u2019s workload that AI can handle, the higher the predicted risk \u2014 regardless of how many tasks or AI systems are involved.", "\ud83d\udcca Key Takeaways from the Analysis: \ud83d\udd39 Only about 2% of jobs are at high risk of full elimination by AI. \ud83d\udd39 A majority (~69%) of roles fall into the low-risk category, indicating AI is more likely to support  than replace them. \ud83d\udd39 Repetitive, low-task, administrative roles are most vulnerable to automation. \ud83d\udd39 AI Workload Ratio is the most reliable predictor of AI impact, not task count or number of AI models. \ud83d\udd39 Most jobs are being reshaped, not removed \u2014 AI is transforming work, not taking it away completely.", "Artificial Intelligence is not a job destroyer \u2014 it\u2019s a powerful tool reshaping how we work. The majority of jobs studied are more likely to be transformed than eliminated. Roles involving repetitive and rule-based tasks are most vulnerable to automation. Data-driven classification helps policymakers and workers prepare proactively. The future of work will rely on human-AI collaboration, not competition.Rather than fearing AI, we should adapt and evolve with it.", "Dataset Source UnclePablo. (2023).
