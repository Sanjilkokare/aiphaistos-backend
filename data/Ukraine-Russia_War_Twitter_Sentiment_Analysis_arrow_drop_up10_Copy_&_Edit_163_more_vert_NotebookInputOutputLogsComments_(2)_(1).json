Many countries support Ukraine by imposing economic sanctions against Russia. It generated millions of tweets reflecting fear, anger, hope, and global solidarity. Russia on 24 February 2022 launched a wave of missile attacks across many of Ukraine\u2019s biggest cities. At least seven civilians were killed and 33 injured between Wednesday and Thursday, Ukraine\u2019s presidential office said, including one person killed and 23 wounded when four Kalibr cruise missiles hit the southern city of Mykolaiv. A i m This presentation aims to analyze that public emotion using natural language processing specifically, by comparing a machine learning model trained on tweet data with VADER, a rule-based sentiment analyzer designed for social media.", "Source: Kaggle \u2013 Amir Motefaker's Ukraine\u2013Russia War Tweets Dataset   ~10,000+ tweets collected during the early phase of the conflict   Key columns used: tweet (text) language (filter for English) username (user frequency, optional) Preprocessing: Removed URLs, hashtags, mentions, special characters Converted to lowercase Stored cleaned version in 'cleaned_tweet'    DATASET OVERVIEW", "TEXT PREPROCESSING Removed: URLs, mentions, hashtags, special characters Lowercased and cleaned: e.g., 'WAR!!!' \u2192  'war' Result saved as: 'tweet' Cleaned text enables consistent vectorization and model performance.
